{"id":"diary-djf","title":"Timeline event click should scroll to related diary text","description":"When clicking on an event dot in the timeline (especially Edgar's personal diary events), the app should scroll the diary panel to the corresponding section of text. Currently, clicking events only adjusts the slider position but doesn't scroll the text.\n\nExpected behavior:\n- Clicking a diary event (red dot) like 'Edgar lands in France' should scroll to that section\n- Only diary-type events should scroll (not general historical events without diary content)\n- Should scroll to first location mention in the related_places array\n\nTechnical notes:\n- Event dots already have click handlers that adjust the slider\n- Need to add scroll-to-text logic using related_places\n- Can reuse existing location scroll code","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"james.goldwater@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-31T11:32:44.483002744+01:00","created_by":"James Goldwater","updated_at":"2026-01-31T11:34:06.625315167+01:00","closed_at":"2026-01-31T11:34:06.625315167+01:00","close_reason":"Fixed in PR #1"}
