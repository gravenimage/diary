                <h1>Edgar Hopkins' WW2 Diary</h1>
<h2>Last Days in England and My Experiences on the Continent</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Dedication</h3>
<p><em>This work is dedicated to Winnie Hopkins, Edgar's beloved and devoted wife for forty seven years and to his grandchildren Juliette and James. He was very proud of them both and loved them dearly, as they loved him.</em></p>
<p><em>"To live in the hearts of those we love is not to die"</em></p>
<hr />
<p>I am starting this story while on a 24 hours rest period near the little village of Crépon in Normandy. We get these short rests every now and again, for most of the time on the gun site calls for our being on hours on end during the night. I thought I would like to write of my experiences, which if I come through safely will be interesting to read when I am home. I don't know yet what dangers I have to face, but I pray everything will be alright and I get back safe and sound to Winnie.</p>
<p>It is a coincidence that the unit I'm with totals up to 13, considered to be unlucky, which is the 90th (City of London) Battery, 113th Regt and 76th Brigade. The gun team I'm with is as follows – Sgt Morris No1, myself No2, Frank Davis No3, Jack Dutton No4, Albert Manger No5, Alec Moffat No6, Arthur Bottomley No7, Bert Bradley No8 and Bernard Belsham No9. I get on well with all of them, and my real friends are Frank Davis and Alec Moffat. Frank comes from St Albans in Hertfordshire and Alec from Glasgow. I have known them for five months and have been with him on the same team ever since we went Mobile. We have been to many firing camps on AA shoots, at Aberporth (twice), Burrowhead, Towyn and Clacton. We also had a tank shoots at Ramsgate, Margate, Otterburn and another place in Northumberland the name of which I can't quite think of at the moment of writing. Arthur Bottomley is another man I respect, being straightforward and honest. At times the other men in the Battery think he is a "cissy" just because he neither smokes, drinks or swears.</p>
<p>My last few days in England were spent at <span class="location" data-place-id="southampton">Southampton</span>, but before that I had been at <span class="location" data-place-id="southend">Southend</span> for five months. I will say that I have been with the same Battery since I joined up on November 14th 1940. We had been mobile for over twelve months, on schemes and main firing camps, so we were not surprised to hear we would be in the Invasion. A recce party was formed, and I was one of the 15 men that were due to go to <span class="location" data-place-id="southampton">Southampton</span> prior to going abroad. At <span class="location" data-place-id="southend">Southend</span> I made friends, and Mrs Woodlands had invited me to spend a weekend with them, so I was hoping our stay there would be sufficient for me to ask Winnie, my wife, to come over. How nice that would be. But after three days came an order to move. I was disappointed, for I had got used to <span class="location" data-place-id="southend">Southend</span>. Mrs Woodlands was sorry too, and asked me to write, and above all not to forget, and hoped we would spend some time with them after the war.</p>
<p>I wondered how long that would be. I was sad to leave next day, and said goodbye to one of our finest officers who would not be coming with us. His parting words to us were "Don't forget to keep your heads down". We left <span class="location" data-place-id="southend">Southend</span> on May 22nd <em>[1944]</em> for an unknown destination. Frank said in a joke "See you on the other side". We broke our journey in London for a snack then proceeded on to <span class="location" data-place-id="southampton">Southampton</span>. We all thought it was going to be Winchester. Arriving at the big camp in the woods, which was full of all sorts of troops, including Yanks, we got busy making the tent comfortable. It was two inches thick in dust, so we placed newspapers and straw down. I had been to this camp before, and I liked the scenery. They were glorious summer days and I began to wish I was free to enjoy them with Winnie, but here I was about to set off on one of the adventures of my life. Could you wonder then why I felt so depressed and sad. I looked round at all the men, and wondered how many would come through this safely. I fell to wondering how they would take the news at home, for I knew I was the last to know, as even though they would start worrying, and that I wouldn't have any letters which would make matters worse, for they are the one thing which makes me keep bright and helps contented.</p>
<p>I had spent my last leave, a 24 hours, on May 17th. I didn't know then it was my last, for there was always the chance of another 24. I had prepared Winnie for the shock, for one day we were in the bedroom we had hired to store some of our things on May 17th when we were in the bedroom we had hired to store some of our things, and I remember saying on May 17th when we were in the bedroom that it may be our last time together for a time. The tears came, and I was sorry I had said it, but these things had got to be faced. We had spent many happy days and nights together. We wasn't a happier couple, but the heartbreak of it all. We had been courting for two years, my leaves were looked forward to after a few days and met her, it was fine and true, loyal and kind hearted. We had many things in common, and I have since blessed the day we met, and that happy day of September 11th when we were married – a day to be remembered. My thoughts go back of her at this camp, and I also hope Mother and Dad– how would they feel about it all. It was always when I went on leave, she would say "Do you think you will have to go?" and I would reply "or perhaps by the time I knew it would not be long. I strolled about the camp, mostly with Tom Jones, a young lad of 22. He hadn't been home for six months. While we were there they started a 24 hours, and it was, and I was looking forward to going on the 27th May, but on the Friday night the camp was sealed, which meant nobody was allowed out.</p>
<p>Our days at the camp were fairly easy, with lectures on mines – the things we feared, not knowing much about them. At night we either played "Housey", which is a card game, or went to the camp cinema, but it was very stuffy in the tent and I preferred to be outside. Every now and then a loudspeaker would blare out from the trees asking for an officer to report to the movement control office. It was like a fairground, and the Yanks had some records playing, and on our parts of the camp football and baseball were in progress. The weather was very hot, the temperature about 87.</p>
<p>I shall never forget the last night, May 31st. The birds were singing, and I thought of the past summers when I was free to do as I liked. We had been paid 200 francs in French money, so we knew this was the place we were bound for. A supper was laid on at 10.30 that night, for we were to move out at 12.30. With our big packs on our backs we were marched down to the lorries which were to take us to the docks. The night was dark, and it was drizzling. We rested on the pavement, and if anyone wanted to vanish, I wouldn't have been much trouble. After cruising around, in the early hours of the morning we eventually arrived at <span class="location" data-place-id="southampton">Southampton</span> Docks at 7am. Much was going on there, all kinds of vehicles were being loaded. It was a strange feeling I had when I stepped off the shores of England on the big boat and I wondered how long it would be before I saw England again. The dangers were great, I realised all that, and I thought what my reactions would be when I stepped on the beach of France, if I got there.</p>
<p>I went to my bunk and didn't think of looking again at England until we had got well out. The anchor was dropped and for four days we stayed there. Our officers briefed us, and we looked at the map of France, just where we were going to land – if we were lucky. The food was very good, the best of everything, and the Americans did us well. It was very quiet on the boat, and I wondered if we would be alright. All sorts of units were with us, and one Scot was saying "I wish we'd get thrown into the water will our Mae Wests be alright?" A couple of balloons on barges or a balloon seemed to be very alright?" A couple of balloons from a launch to a battleship. It gave you a spectacle it was to see every kind of boat from a launch to a battleship. It gave you a feeling of confidence. There were plenty of cigarettes at a very cheap price on board, but I missed the papers. I did one of my tricks, I did one dead on the tank deck, and it was stuffy down below. I looked on vehicles I had never seen before, the amphibious ducks which proved their worth later.</p>
<p>On the night of June 5th we set sail for France. The seas were choppy, and as we got out into the Channel it got worse. I was sea-sick, this is a nasty thing. The boat rocked from side to side, and I knew it wouldn't be long before I was sick. It's strange, but true, that when you are sick you don't care what happens. I slept a little and we were wakened and told to get our kit on. As we approached the French coast we could hear the battleships firing. I expected to see plenty of our planes, but I only saw one. I learned later on most of them were doing good work farther in. We dropped anchor close in, for we had to wait for a way in. The gun emplacements were cunningly hidden, and they took some silencing, but the Navy kept up the shelling.</p>
<p>From 12 o'clock on the morning of June 6th, a day I thought of, for it was the anniversary of our engagement, until 12 o'clock at night we stayed there. It Jerry had had the planes we must have been bombarded, but I never saw one, only our own, which I by this time had added up themselves were doing much as they liked, a good job for us, I thought. Infantry craft were going in, they did a good job. The waves were showing white, and the Rhino which is a craft for taking vehicles across was having a tough time battling against the waves. We hoped it would come soon as it was a suspense waiting, but eventually it reached our boat, the number of which was 2920, totalling 13, which seems to be our lucky number.</p>
<p>Fully an hour went by before the Rhino got hitched up, as it was very rough. Our Recce party went on, and amidst the noise of the waves, the drone of a German Bomber was heard. A smoke screen was put up, and we had some nasty moments when it dived down to release the bombs which fell harmlessly in the sea. I crouched there and prayed we would land safely. Fires were burning on the shore, and as we approached, we had another terrifying moment for the sailors shouted to us to get well back, a Log was afloat, and they thought a mine was on it, but they steered safely by, and we finally reached the dry land at 12.45am June 7th.</p>
<p>It was a strange feeling to first set foot on French soil, and we walked carefully without incident along the beach, and we lay down and tried to sleep until 5am, when we were to go to our gun position. Dead were lying everywhere, and wounded were in a tent. The RAMC did great work attending the wounded of ours and the Germans. It was the first time I saw one, and he was dead on a stretcher. Seven others were lying on stretchers, and they looked a surly lot. A German Officer (a sniper) killed many of our lads, and he was making signs for a cigarette and drink. In another pillbox a dead German lay riddled with bullets, he had been firing to the last. Our planes, the Typhoons and Spitfires were roaring overhead, and it was a great sight to see them. The Germans looked up as if to say "Here they come, they are ours". A dozen of our planes swept in from land, and our ships fired at them thinking they were Jerry's. One Spitfire crashed, but the pilot got out. There weren't taking any chance. A couple of Typhoons broke away, and a hail of bullets went up from our boats. They swerved and got away safely. It seemed mad to me for our lot to fire on our own planes. With our guns I have seen it is different and they are very good. At the moment when the G.L. but the Bofors and smaller groups just let go at anything. I have seen this happen many times in the midst of June, a sight like Blackpool the mass of tracers going up. After they have dropped the recognition lights I have still seen them fired on. What must the pilots think of the ack-ack? –not much I know. We have been standing out and planes have gone and we have asked "Why don't we fire?" but I would sooner stand out half the night than fire on our own, but sometimes it is the pilots own fault, for being careless and not showing the I.F.F. <em>[Interrogation Friend or Foe]</em> Well to get back to my story, we stayed until the morning –June 7- trying to sleep on the sand, it was very cold , not a bit like June. A German plane flew in at 4.30 am, and dropped bombs. I covered myself over with a tin hat on my face, and hoped he wouldn't machine gun.</p>
<p>We proceeded to our site, after making ourselves a breakfast with the 24 hours pack. I felt better after a drink. Our gun position was chosen, where our Flying Fortress had dropped their bombs, intended for some houses which held machine gun posts. The ground was all bomb craters, but our bombers had missed the target. On our way to the site my eyes were everywhere. Something was worrying, and I noticed there weren't any trees or hedges, but the open fields. Corn crops looked well I thought. Notices were up on boards which said "Achtung Minens", and here and there a dead German lay, twisted up and lying in a peculiar position. The snipers had paid the full penalty. They were still hiding about, and while we were filling in bomb craters to make them firm for the guns a bullet whistled by and narrowly missed Jones, and we quickly got down below ground. Our planes were patrolling the skies, and as yet I hadn't seen any enemy plane while we were working there. A lot of Marauders went across flying low, and we saw Jerry's ack-ack bursts which were very concentrated.</p>
<p>We had been there digging most of the day when I and 3 others were sent down to the beach to bring our guns to the position. The road was a stream of vehicles, and clouds of dust arose. I walked along the road to see what had happened to No 4 gun which was last of off, and they were having trouble, for the sand was giving. I went back again, for they were too far out for my liking. So I strolled back after being there from 4 o'clock till 8.30. I was hungry so out came my ration pack and a tin of corned beef. I asked, "or "asked" a rather mad signs with a French farmer for water, but I couldn't make him understand, so gave it up as a bad job. No sooner had I got back than the gun arrived so we set about the work of getting it into action and making a place to sleep but we didn't get much that night, for the firing started soon after dark, and we blazed away like mad. From then until a fortnight later we were out every night, the most firing we have ever done. The third week wasn't quite so bad, but we were still being called out at all hours. Those first nights were like the illuminations at Blackpool, and one in particular was thrilling. As a plane approached searchlights flashed out and held it, and a stream of tracers went up. Our own guns joined in, and try as it would Jerry couldn't escape. They crashed in flames in the sea.</p>
<p>Day after day, and night after night, they would come in and I saw a Focke Wolf 190 chased by Spitfires which stood no chance. This plane is very fast and from the time we came unto action we shot down six planes, mostly FWs and ME 109s during the day have been brought down. But at these are not the only ones I have seen, for some of our lads crashed as well. One night a Spitfire made a forced landing and one of our lads went over. The accidental pilot said "I'll get the bastard who got me". I saw our bombers returning from a raid, and the shell bursts of the Germans was the most concentrated I have seen. How the hell they got through I don't know. A Fortress circled the site, and the crew had baled out, they were travelling towards the German lines as they fell from a great height. The Fortress' wing crumpled, and it crashed heavily, another fighter nose dived into the sea also. We did not see him bale out. Another morning an ME109 flew low, and I did not see all that happened, for it was 7 45 and we had long been in bed, but we heard machine gun fire, and the Bofors gun opened up and shot off part of its wing – another one that didn't get back to tell the tale.</p>
<p>At night we had thrills and excitement and it was a sight to see the thousands of red tracers and flares dropping. We did not get much sleep, for one thing I was overtired, but we had a few hours off in the afternoon. The bomb craters came in useful as we made them our sleeping quarters. We had stretchers with us, and it looked strange to see us around the crater with our gas capes as cover. The weather was very unsettled with low cloud, and the German planes came in occasionally during the day. Just when you had got comfortable out we would go, and the same at night. To my mind there is nothing worse than to be suddenly awakened from a sleep. We had to be quick, the guns were ready for action within a minute. We had to work hard too digging and carrying ammunition. The boxes hold two rounds, the weight approximately 1 cwt. They are about the awkwardest boxes I've handled, and it was nothing fresh to for us for the lads to pinch their hands. As we stood out at night we grumbled, but we didn't mind much as long as we were doing some good, we were defending the beach head. Incidentally, our Regt along with another were the first to land, an honour ,our Colonel told us, to be in a few hours after D- Day. Our food was in concentrated form, and we had lashings of biscuits.</p>
<p>It is July 9 now and we haven't tasted any bread, but I am in the pink of condition. My letters from Winnie, and her home looked forward to with pleasure and I'm more contented. I have seen the French civilians, but it isn't any use talking – a pity we can't talk French. The fields are ripening fast, and the poppies are a pretty site <em>(sic)</em>. We had been there over a week, and here we were always out from 10.15 to 11.45 at night and again from 5am to 6am, a "stand to". For the first 5 days we would watch our planes Spitfires, Typhoons and Mustangs coming from England to take over the patrol of the skies. They didn't meet much opposition. I saw the first Spitfire land on French soil. It had to. A French soil. The Bulldozers had made a way, trampling down the corn for landing strips. We moved farther along the coast after a brief stay. More work and groans, but we got to our new position and hardly got the guns into action when we soon started firing. Those June nights were cold, and I wondered if they were experiencing the same weather in England. We had the guns by a clover field on ground level, then on the following 4 days we moved 200 yards alongside a wheat field, took us 4 days to dig the pits, for the ground was clay. Every night we had an action alarm, and one night I was scared, when I heard a whistling noise through the air, a landmine had dropped some distance away, intended for the aerodromes. We were stationed on an aerodrome the way, and what with the beach head and drones we knew we were going to fire a lot. I thought one night a plane was going to crash, for it sailed over the guns and dropped a couple of bombs. Then we hear shell splinters falling -several times it's been close, for a piece hit an ammo base with a nasty thud, that it makes me wonder if we shall be lucky. The searchlights showing up the guns, and heaps of red tracers makes the sky like Guy Fawkes night. We also hear the field guns firing away at <span class="location" data-place-id="caen">Caen</span> and Cherbourg. I think they are worse off than us. Each night we watch for German planes coming in to our guny, and Ben Parsons will say "Come on in my chicks" or "Come on in you soff B---- before you get shot down by our lot". A Canadian passed by one day and said "We don't like you guys" and no wonder, for it makes you think sometimes if the ack-ack is all that it's claimed. Our sheltere is on ground level, with a tarpaulin over us, our stretchers have been taken away, and it is very uncomfortable on the hard ground. Our tempers are none too good, when we get a sudden alarm. But we are soon ourselves again when the guns are fired. We have made a dug-out for a firearm in. You will ask what for. Well we have come by some "compo packs" and we have a tasty feast. Frank and I were down one night at 12 o'clock making some hot veg and pudding, went down nice, for we get very hungry. Frank is my best pal and we get on well together.</p>
<p>About this same time our officers were very unsettled, why they should grumble I don't know for they have children to wait on hand and foot, they do not rough it like us. We've got no time for them, and they are called Leaders of Men. One night it was daylight, and we saw 7 Parachutes come floating down, and an officer said "Let them have it lads", yet they were miles away from us. A Fortress crashed soon after. We see our planes going out and in the distance ack-ack bursts of Jerry's are very concentrated. The officers thought we weren't doing enough, for they wanted the guns shiny, and made ultimatums to the effect that they had got to be cleaned at a certain hour. Ernie Morris, our number one, had been sent back to England following an accident one night. A premature round from No 2 gun burst outside the barrel, wounding five, and it was a miracle one was killed. That night I was off duty, but I might as well have been on, for every time our gun fired I had a nasty shock from blast. Albert Manger was on my job that night as No 2, and he told me afterwards a piece of shell case came flashing by his face. It made me think, that I might have been sitting a bit different to him, and I thanked God for it. Morris was shaken, and didn't get over the shock for a bit. Bert Bradley had his face cut. The command post was splintered and two of the men got hurt, one in the leg (he went to England as well) and Jim Cowley who was hurt in the thigh. This is the second time Jim has been hurt by a premature. You can never tell what is going to happen when the guns are fired. Ernie Morris was sent back to England. He had surprised me somehow while he was over here, for he did not strike me as being so cool in action. Over in England , we had all said he kept so cool and collected, and all the firing camps had proved this. Bernard Belsham took over, but not for long, he had a few words with the officers over the work, and the maintenance of the gun. They weren't satisfied, so the result was handing in his stripes. Soon after 4 more handed theirs in. Things were very unsettled, and a meeting was held, and the result of this was that every morning we would have to sleep irrespective of a call out, until 11, a wash and shave and then dinner, starting again at one, and work until 5 o'clock. This arrangement is satisfactory, but we have were not had one night free but what there was a raid. Every third night we did a 2 hours guard, so you can tell we didn't get such a lot of sleep. At it sometime. When it rains it pours, and imagine, but it's surprising how soon it dries up. It is rather monotonous on a gun site, for it is a 24 hours job, and you can't wander. We don't see our planes flying about, and on the night of July 8 we saw a great sight, our Bombers about five or six hundred came in to bomb <span class="location" data-place-id="caen">Caen</span>. They were mostly Lancasters and Halifaxes with plenty of fighters. They just went in, and dropped their bombs, and returned. One Lancaster crashed, but we saw the crew bale out. A Typhoon dived to earth with its wing shot away. That same night we were called out, and, after 20 rounds, Jerry starts machine gunning the various sites, but we have been alright so far.</p>
<p>I have made a diary of the events from the day of July 7 Friday. The days have gone by very quick, and I am wondering if we shall get some leave. I have travelled from the site on fatigues to some afternoon, and along the road from Crépon I saw the graves with little wooden crosses where our lads have been buried. Some day their folk will come to France to see them. It is sad to think of all this, a mad-people, with so much to do in life, and yet there has be war. I visited the Church of Crépon on a 24 hours, and I thought what a nice place it was, the carved statues, of Christ on the Cross, caught my eye, and I stood a while looking at it. Shell holes at the top of the tower were made, if I remove the snipers, I expect I thought they were safe in there. In the Churchyard were two graves of our airmen. We did not stay there long, and went down to the lodgings in the barn. Crépon could not have seen so many vehicles pass through the village. One day I am going to <span class="location" data-place-id="bayeux">Bayeux</span>. Some of the lads have been. There is plenty of butter and cheese, but we were advised, those that went, to take some biscuits, for in a doubtful if they would get anything in the cafes. Near the gun site a trench made by the Germans runs a long way and we have made it useful. The gun teams have dug in for their shelter. Poppies grow profusely in these fields, and the corn is beginning to turn a golden yellow. It is all digging, and now they have fetched a shed from <span class="location" data-place-id="caen">Caen</span>, which we are going to use for a canteen, and for ENSA shows, if we are here long enough.</p>
<p>I have heard today July 13th that we shall get some leave on the 14th of August. I only hope it is true, but many rumours go round. I am looking forward to returning home again, and somehow I think the time is not far off when the war is over. We were sitting in the dug-out one night, with the tea going and the tea made, it would be about 11 o'clock and as yet the stand to period wasn't over. Frank and I were in on our own talking of home life and comforts. The Major came in, and we thought it unusual for it is the first time he has addressed himself talkative to the men. He asked us if we were happy. He said as long as we did plenty of firing life on a gun site wasn't quite so bad. All our time isn't spent here, for we leave two guns out of action every day to go down to the beach head to help unload the Ducks, which carry all sorts of stuff down from the boats. Compo packs are favourites, and we have had one occasionally. I don't suppose they are missed, but during my time in the army I have seen plenty of scrounging. Down on the beach work is going on, and Vehicles are taking ammunition of all types. We have been a big help, but on some days I don't feel much like work, for after all not having the sleep throughout the night makes us feel like this. The houses are knocked about, and it will be a long time before everything is put right again. I often wonder what these French people think, whether they are really thankful of the Allies coming. Passing though the various villages, I've studied the expressions, and they haven't seemed to be so happy. British troops are making a fuss of the children and I have noticed those round about 10 years smoke, and go up to the men and ask for cigarettes and light.</p>
<p>I went down to <span class="location" data-place-id="bayeux">Bayeux</span> for the first time July 17. It is a biggish place, and it is not knocked about a lot. I noticed what I could, and my impressions of it were not so good. There is a long street from the main gate, and along each side of the road some water of a swampy character runs, which smells unpleasant. The road is made of bricks and the pavements are a yard wide or so. You have to be very careful how you walk. The place is alive with troops, and I did not enjoy my visit. If it wasn't for the Language and the French names over the doorways you wouldn't know but what it was an English town. There has been plenty of things in the shops, but these have been sold long ago. I had hoped to get a present for Winnie, but perhaps in the near future we shall prove to another place. There is plenty of Red Butter and Cheese priced at 400 francs – 4 shillings in English money, and we have bought some to eat with our biscuits. I visited a cathedral, a fine old building beautiful in every sense of its worth anyone's time in seeing. I returned to camp feeling tired, for the day was very hot.</p>
<p>The weather has been unsettled most of June, and it doesn't seem much like summer. We are still having alarms at night, mostly between 11.30 and 2.30am. On July 7 we saw while standing out a plane, and then after it went low over the guns. The tracers from the smaller guns are a sight, and it is a noise to hear all the guns opening up. When I'm traversing round following a target, I wonder if anything will happen, and occasionally a piece of red hot splinter comes whistling through the air. One night we had a scare, to hear two unexploded shells come close, and another night when we were digging, I was soaked in Butter Oil, for someone had forgotten to screw in the pin of the gravity tank. The first I knew something serious had happened, for every time the gun recoiled it made a noise like rushing water. About 6 or 7 hundred Lancasters on the night of July 10th raided <span class="location" data-place-id="caen">Caen</span>. We looked up and watched them cross the sight. The Jerry's ack-ack was intense at first, but got weaker. I saw one Lancaster crash, but the crew baled out. A Spitfire made a nose dive and fell to pieces, with the pilot saved. July 17 was a day of thrills and excitement, and I saw a fight in the sky by a Spitfire and an ME109. The ME got rid of its petrol tanks and I saw them leave the plane. The ME was shot down, but the pilot escaped by parachute. At night we were called out at 12.15. We were soon in action and had ceased loading after engaging one target when another ( someone said it was the Black Widow, which is a modified Lockheed Lightning) dived very low, about 20 feet over No 4 and 3 gun. We had a 3 man. We had a 3 gun now but wouldn't have got up the button and a stream of lead would surely have got us. We have had plenty of excitement and thrills, but of the wrong sort.</p>
<p>I'm going to write now extracts from Troop Orders which are – Our Brigade the 76th claims 6 enemy planes at present, but more to be investigated. ME109 shot down during July15 &amp; 16. RAF make no claims. Between 20 and 25 enemy aircraft operating over the beachhead during the night of 14th and 15th RAF sends thanks to AA, for good work. At 19.30 hours on Friday 15th 12 ME 109's were engaged by Spitfires.2 MEs down. RAF thank A.A for not interfering with their activities. The 76th Brigade Commander thanks the men for good work during the weeks of Invasion, and claims 23 enemy aircraft. Nearly all enemy planes coming into our area have been engaged. We have cancelled all daylight engagements for our own planes have been fired on, with pilots killed and wounded. They do not attach any blame on us, for only 2 of our own have been fired on by this Brigade. New AA Regiments have come in, including the RAR Regiment have been responsible for the damage. As I have wrote <em>(sic)</em> in these notes I have seen for myself other lighter guns firing. The 3.7 are predictors, and it is often a mistake is made, and sometimes it is the carelessness of the pilots, who fail to show recognition signals. We wonder if all the nights we are going to be the same, but as the days go by the activities get less, and it is not so bad.</p>
<p>We are doing some useful work at the docks, unloading all kinds of stuff, from the smaller type of ammunitions to 500 /600 lb bombs. It is a change to get away from the same scenery day in and day out, but on our 24 hrs Frank and I go out. One day we visited <span class="location" data-place-id="creully">Cruelly</span> <em>(<span class="location" data-place-id="creully">Creully</span>)</em>, about 5 miles away. Frank and I strolled about and saw a crowd queuing up for a show, so we went in to see the first ENSA Party. I quite enjoyed it. Coming out we went in to a Café, for a drink of coffee, a small glass of putrid liquid, which didn't taste much like the name, costing 5 francs. "Coffee La" said the fellow, and we held two fingers up. The place was full of flies, never have I seen so many in a café, and I thought of all those we visited in <span class="location" data-place-id="southend">Southend</span> – what a different places in France. We tried the little bit of French we knew, for what few different places in France. We tried the little bit of French we knew, for what few brought the drinks we said "Maircy meel fwah" <em>(sic)</em> which means "Thanks a lot" in English <em>[Merci beaucoup]</em> I visited a farm, and asked the farmer to buy a 1lb of butter, and I asked for a kilo, which I thought was a lb, but Madame kept plastering it on. I said to Frank "It's not 1lb we're buying but 2 by the look of things" Frank picked up the weight while she went into the back room to see if there was any mark on it, but some Canadians came to our rescue, for one spoke in French, and told her exactly how much we wanted. Proceeding back, the butter began to melt, and we went into a garden to get some dock leaves, which certainly saved our butter. I saw some beautiful dark red Dahlias in there and some nice Geraniums. We had a lift down to walk back. The day was very warm. Ever since July 12 the weather has slowly improved and even now in August 10 there has been no break in the spell. The farmers are busy harvesting, and the field of wheat by our site is cut. I've struck a few up in my spare time at night, and 2 of the other lads have lent a hand. The farmer will think a fairy godmother has been busy.</p>
<p>On August Monday I spent a busy day at <span class="location" data-place-id="arromanches">Arromanches</span> unloading the Dukurs, barbed wire and ammo. The artillery moved off that day, the other unit takes over at 7 or 8 o'clock. It was a hot day. I've had my shirt off and have got a tan. Our dug-outs are finished, and we have made a wooden frame each for our beds. It is comfortable but we have many "visitors", including earwigs, beetles, mice and even a mole is worming his way in. I sleep soundly, but not so soundly. We have had some very quiet nights these few nights of August. Every other night I go down with about a dozen others for a swim, and strangely enough at the same place we landed. The tide goes out a long way and it is very level except for a few holes. The sailors off the ships play football in their spare time. I've enjoyed the bathing. Frank and I had a look at the graves of the men who had lost their lives. Small wooden crosses indicated where they were buried. I did not think much of the burial place, for it was a trench on the beachside, and lying close together, 42 other graves were fenced off and on one, this little reading "Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your work, and glorify our God which is in Heaven". I felt very sad to think of it all.</p>
<p>We hope and pray that the war will soon be over. Although it can be monotonous on a gun site we occasionally see some thrills. All the while our planes, Typhoons, Spitfires, roar around creating much noise. I have visited an aerodrome of Typhoons, and had a good look at these planes, which are doing good work, fitted with 8 rockets and 4 cannons. I've also been a few times to an ex Jerry gun site, have found an almanack of theirs for a souvenir, and brought back some shell cases, with which we have been working on to make some candlesticks.</p>
<p>On Sunday night August 6th I was writing in the "clay hole" when a plane flew very low and going outside, we saw the Marauder returning from a raid lose height and crash near Crépon. A great cloud of smoke poured out and we learned after that the 3 were killed. I think they were trying to make a landing for one engine had failed and tragic sight .Twenty thousand gallons of petrol went up in flames. I think the story a little far fetched concerning the petrol. But there are plenty of these and boxes of ammo stacked in the fields of France. Most any night we were out, 4 times in all that we never got much sleep. The times of Reveille is altered now, and we have breakfast at 8 o'clock. Still this arrangement is alright providing we don't get a "stand to's". Today stands for the 10th I saw an ME109 shot down by a Typhoon, and at dinner time we saw a Liberator do the most amazing things in the sky, after the crew had safely baled out. The plane went up straight, down again, and up, and finally crash. Day after day is nothing but the sound of our own planes, but sometimes they are forced, through bad weather conditions, to stay on the ground and it is then we notice how quiet it is. We have seen some peculiar things happen at night, Bofor shells going up, and yet we do not hear a plane. One night about a fortnight ago, a plane flew low, with a few light AA guns firing. It was a 3 A 3 colours, I red and 2 white, but a no colour is never used by our own aircraft, guns fired like mad at it. I have seen this happen before, Jerry dropping the colours hoping he would find the right ones.</p>
<p>These August days are very hot, and every other night we have been to the sea for a swim. A dry spell was broken on August 15 with a heavy thunderstorm. Balloons have been struck by lightening, and I have seen well over a dozen burst in flames. The fields of cut corn look a pleasing sight. The Typhoons create much noise, and we see plenty of Dakotas (transport planes) flying around. About the 6th day, these planes were flying towards and backwards to England carrying the wounded, and there are plenty of planes now doing good work. Towards dusk the fighters, Spitfires and Typhoons, come in to land, with the recognition lights on ; they don't intend to be fired on. All the guns have not all the guns have now been scrapped, one out of action for a week. We did not have to go out when there was an alarm and while No 4 gun was being painted there were three action calls, with some firing. I thought, well, we're over here for that, and yet guns were put out of action for the sake of painting. It's all pomp and glory now the British army has stood the test of 3 nights firing, but on the night of August 20th Sunday we fired at a low angle, and the blast from our gun tore the tarpaulin in several places, with the soil falling on our blankets. On one occasion Frank and I were on a 24 hours and were in our dug-out when they fired. I can say that it's not at all pleasant to be in, for the noise is deafening, and something falls each time the guns fire. A rifle will come down, dixie cans, and any washing or clothes hanging up.</p>
<p>The days go by fairly quickly, and we are doing something always. Arthur Bottomley like his tea, and has had some sent from home, so we make a brew during the morning. Our trouble is getting milk, so we manage to scrounge a drop from somewhere. One day we brewed up, so having no milk I took my mug and got a pint from the cow which is tethered near the barn. I had to have the help of Ben Parsons to stand on the chair, else I wouldn't have got anywhere near her. The cows are tethered everywhere, and I am keenly keeping, and I am keeping, and I am keenly keeping their eyes on the cart to fresh pastures. Two haven't had occasion to fire while they have been so close, but it won't be so nice for them when we do. Sometimes we are cropped up every day, either to go down to the beach for unloading purposes, or fetching firewood. Yes, we manage to have hot water sometimes, for a big oil drum is used, and on we have a shower bath rigged up which is a peculiar affair but it serves it's purpose. We wash our own clothes and they dry quickly in these summer days. I wouldn't say they were snow white, but a lot of the dirt is removed. It must be almost like the time when Winnie will be doing these jobs for us both, and I'm longing for that day to come when we settle down together, and it can't come quick enough. I'm trying not to get into sad moods at times, for you can get fed up with having the same company all the time. I get on with the majority of them. Frank is my best pal, and I'm glad of his friendship.</p>
<p>We spend our evenings now in the recreation room that stood on a site near <span class="location" data-place-id="caen">Caen</span>. In this room we read, write, play darts and various other things, and it is a nice change from being in the dug-out, a wireless is installed which makes it heaps better, but we wonder how long it will be before we move. There are no alarms now at night except for the nights we are on guard, which is almost every other night. We enjoy a nice sleep, different from the first 7 weeks. We have invited four people to spend a social evening with us and I must say it was a pleasant evening, singing all the old songs that I love to hear. On one of my 24 hours I went with Frank to a barn which acts as a cinema, in the small village of Crépon, the roof was pierced in many places, throwing light in, which is not good for the screen. But it was another chance, as I have already said that life on a gun site is very monotonous, and we are glad to escape for a few hours. The bells of Crépon Church brings to my mind ours at <span class="location" data-place-id="middleton">Middleton</span>, for the tone is exactly the same. At each weekend I think of what we should be doing if it was peacetime, and I long for the war to end, but I know I shall see plenty of service before I return to England again. I must admit I get into sad moods at times, but I think of Win and wonder what she must feel like too, then I content myself with the thoughts that one day we shall be together for always.</p>
<p>August is drawing to a close and the days are not quite so warm. A rumour goes round that we are about to move, which comes to pass, for on August 31st I leave with the recce party again to an unknown destination. Everything that we are able to carry is packed tight on the lorries, and believe me there is not much room for comfort. I tell Frank to try and get our own beds on to the GTV. I would like Win to see my bed, which is a wooden frame, with a piece of sacking nailed on, and a few strands of rope which nearly acts as springs. Frank has laughed many times, but it is comfort I think about. Well, we moved soon after dinner, and passed through <span class="location" data-place-id="creully">Cruelly</span> <em>[<span class="location" data-place-id="creully">Creully</span>]</em>, <span class="location" data-place-id="caen">Caen</span>, <span class="location" data-place-id="falaise">Falaise</span>, <span class="location" data-place-id="argentan">Argatan</span> <em>[Arganan]</em>, St Hilaire, <span class="location" data-place-id="laigle">Laigle</span> <em>[<span class="location" data-place-id="laigle">l'Aigle</span>]</em> and other small places, which I can't quite keep in my memory. The town of <span class="location" data-place-id="falaise">Falaise</span> is very badly knocked about, and there are not many houses or other buildings standing. One heap of rubble, this is what war does, that it makes you wonder if the people of the world are mad. But I suppose it has to be done to remove Jerry.</p>
<p>I liked the travelling seeing new places. The people were very pleased at seeing the British and I compared them with the Normandy people who are very dour. They have suffered, these people at a further inland, and it is said they were on the verge of starving. The people are dressed smartly I thought, but they would surely have felt the pinch sooner or later. Along the roads I saw tanks burnt out, and several horses killed, creating a smell, and a pleasant sight to be sure. The roads are straight for miles, and it is only when you are nearing a town that there are bends in them. They have no hedges, and they are not so pretty as in England. But the roads are straight which is a great thing. Vehicles drive on the right hand side of the road. The people cheer and wave at every allied vehicle. On the Saturday September 2nd we drew in a side lane, and, a man came out of his house shouting "Monseurs, Monseurs, <em>[Messieurs, messieurs]</em> and waving his hands. It is rough and ready this mobile, and we make do with any food and facilities. On Saturday night we stayed in a barn, Cap Thomas made arrangements with the farmer, and also went out and bought some brown bread which was very nice, and the farm people asked us in, and there we were 14 of us sitting round his table. The food was our own but it was a nice thought of the farmer to ask us. He gave us wine to drink, and we wouldn't leave us alone, and as I washed one of them pointed to the soap, and said "sabon mè". <em>[savon]</em> I gave the little girl of 10 a tablet, and then they all wanted one, which was impossible, but they eagerly took the chocolate. That night it rained, but the barn was fairly dry, and next morning we took up our position on the top of a hilly ground exposed to everything. We did what jobs we could such as digging holes for the latrines, and levelling off the gun position, awaiting the arrival and the remainder of the troops which came in on Sunday afternoon Sept 4th. A French man came up on the morning , and spoke to us in their language, trying to make us understand what he was saying, so we could only say, "No compre," I said to him "Comment sur le village" <em>(sic)</em> <em>[Comment s'appelle ce village]</em> and he said "<span class="location" data-place-id="amiens">Amens</span>", and then got his pencil and paper out, and wrote 1914-1918 meaning to say he was in the last war, and then took his hat off revealing a shrapnel wound on his head.</p>
<p>Four miles away lies the city of <span class="location" data-place-id="amiens">Amiens</span> with its beautiful Cathedral standing out as a landmark. We can see for miles and miles this part of the country. Snipers still lurk in the woods, but the FFI (French Interior) are looking after them and have rounded many of them up. We started digging places for the guns, and it is hard work, for the ground is chalky. A few grenades help to loosen the chalk and it is a bit easier. The food is not so good, biscuits are in fashion again and there are many moans. We had a night off to go down to <span class="location" data-place-id="amiens">Amiens</span> and it was an enjoyable evening. The drinking places here are like cafes in England, and very small glasses of Cognac are 2 sh. In one place a civilian was playing an accordion but not many tunes we knew. He would play a couple of times and then take his plate round for money. The civilian population are very pleased to see us, and say "Bonjour Messeurs", and the women with children tell them to go up to us to shake hands. Other kids come up and say "Cigarette for Papa", but they want them for their own use. We wish we knew their language for we could find them very interesting. Coming back, the GTV got lost, and took over an hour to get to camp again, and nights are quiet and there is no action. We do a guard duty every other night for an hour, manning the Bren gun. It is cold standing out, and there are signs of autumn coming. Tea comes up from the wagon lines at 4.30, and when we were sitting in our shelter eating, a civilian comes up and sits in our middle. He is lame and I felt sorry for him. Frank and I give him something to eat, but as we do not man much ourselves, it isn't much we can offer him. His nose nearly popped out of his head when we gave him a piece of bread, and a drink of tea, to which he replied "Maircer bocoo Monseurs". <em>[Merci beaucoup messieurs]</em> The next night he brought us some apples and we enjoyed them. Our shelter is of galvanised sheets and sacks and we shall be alright when it rains. There has been a lot during the night of Sept 6th and 7th so we have stayed in bed. Monday is not so good now, but I suppose one day it will all end, and it will be a great day for us all to go back again. I have seen plenty of things since I left England, and give me the old country every time. The small villages of <span class="location" data-place-id="le_hamel">Le Hamel</span>, Crépon and Arnell-sur-seulles <em>[Anelles?]</em> are knocked about and they caught the full blast of the assault. I wasn't sorry to leave the place. A French dog, whom the lads claimed "Trigger" of No 2 gun visited us while we were there, an unintelligent looking animal he was too. The lads gave him a disc round his neck with the words "Trigger of No 2 gun". A kitten came next, a black and white one which stayed with us so we brought him along with us on the 200 mile journey to <span class="location" data-place-id="amiens">Amiens</span>.</p>
<p>The days are colder now, and there is a chance of us moving again soon. I haven't seen any Germans at this site, and yet this site, and we are enjoying quietness, except for a guard every other night which starts at 10 o'clock. We do an hour each, and work round until 6am, so each of the team get the hour and go on working it backwards from 6am until 10.</p>
<p>It is rather a lonely place situated on top of this high ground, and a few thoughts run through my mind as I stand in this loaded gun, thinking what a life it is to be standing out here, and wishing I was along with Win. I think of her a lot, strange that when you're on your own how many things do pass through your mind. On Sept 11, I thought more, for it is the anniversary of our Wedding Day. Little did I think I should be in France, may be some other country. I never did think the war would be over within a year, but now it is different, but I'm happy to know we are married. The day was brilliant sunshine, a cloudless sky, and a cool wind tempered the heat. I have had no letters from Win for nearly a fortnight. I know she writes regularly. The letters have gone up farther to the front, and it is this reason we aren't getting any.</p>
<p>September 12th brought us another move to the other side of <span class="location" data-place-id="amiens">Amiens</span>, the gun pits were already dug, but still they found us plenty more jobs requiring doing, digging places for latrines and wash places, besides cleaning the gun, which gets in a state from the travelling. French civilians visit us often giving us apples, tomatoes, and a few men have had eggs. The tomatoes are nice, and make a welcome change from army food, which is not very appetising these days. Today Sgt Morris returns from England after his injury earlier on and will be taking over No 4 gun again. This gun site is placed on either side of the road, and places are dug out in the side where we sleep. Alec and I have a comfy little place with a wooden roof, which is warmer than the tins, where moisture collected, making it cold and damp. The French people we see most nights collecting dandelion leaves for their rabbits. One young fellow could speak a little English, and as the Liberators and Fortresses go over to bomb they say "Liber-ators No Bon" <em>(sic)</em>. They like to see British planes, and are excited saying "Boch! Bang". It is strange to hear them talk in their own language. The surrounding country is better here and it looks nice, stretches of fields with a few cluster of trees.</p>
<p>I've never seen many solitary ones yet such as Oak, Elm or Ash. To any one in England the gun site would remind them of a school playground, for many children are around most of the time. There are some nice kiddies, of the affectionate type.</p>
<p>Our stay at <span class="location" data-place-id="amiens">Amiens</span> was almost over, and we had the order to move on Saturday Sept 23rd. The GTVs are stacked full of all sorts of things and even have some tarpaulins and our mobile beds on top. These consist of 4 narrow boards, tied together. The gun team is split into two parties each having a wooden framework, and 2 big tarpaulins to cover over the top. On the Saturday morning all was ready and we had got about a 100 yards from camp when the GTV broke down, and we were left on our own while the remainder of the convoy proceeded on its 75 mile journey to <span class="location" data-place-id="boulogne">Boulogne</span>. Our rations consisted of 21 rounds of bread between 15 men, for we had a 3 tonner lorry along with us as well. The morning was cold and showery, and we stopped a little way from the camp to brew some tea, while the mechanic got busy to get the GTV in working order again. While this was going on I got a few potatoes from a field and Peter Wooldridge, a policeman in civvy street who comes from Birmingham, helped me to scrape and boil the spuds, which went down a treat. Sgt Morris our No 1 who has come back from England again went along to a report centre to see if he could get some rations. At 6 o'clock we went into an enclosed yard and parked there for the night. Electric lights were in the behind houses and we were alright for a sleep. Alec Moffatt and I went out to see if we could do some bargaining, exchanging soap and cigarettes for eggs. The farm house we went to were pleased to see us and found us eggs, and they were glad of the cigs. We were there quite a while and the woman could speak a little English and gave us some home bread. Alec and I then went back to our 'billet', or rather the coaches we were using to spend the night at <span class="location" data-place-id="amiens">Amiens</span> drinking, and we stayed in until 9 o'clock. We had done as regards food very well for our day at <span class="location" data-place-id="crepon">Crepon</span>. Arthur, Alec and I enjoyed the feed, and apart from Mrs S's bread we managed to get plenty of rations. So after an unpromising start we did well for food.</p>
<p>We moved on next morning at 9 o'clock. Sunday was cold and stormy and it wasn't very warm riding. We had gone about 40 miles when the 3 tonner had a puncture so there was a delay. After that the GTV got one, but we reached <span class="location" data-place-id="boulogne">Boulogne</span> at 6.30 that night. The others were already settled, and we set to work getting the gun in action. Fortunately it was fine but cold while we were doing this. The gun position was an old one of Jerry's, vacated hurriedly judging from the things they had left behind in the block houses. We used these for our sleeping quarters, strongly built concrete emplacements. I doubt whether we should have got our tents up with the wind so rough. They do not bother much about you in the army, and we had a job to get something to drink. The cooks gave us a round of bread, a rissole and half a mug of tea that night. We felt better after a sleep, and next day we cleaned the gun, and started to dig in. I don't like the spot at all, it has an unpleasant smell.</p>
<p>We are 2 miles from <span class="location" data-place-id="boulogne">Boulogne</span>. The place itself is a shambles, never have I seen such places so badly bombed by our bombers, and it will take years to build them up again. I've had occasion to go through the place, and what I saw makes me think that war is a horrible thing. People are trudging back to what's left of their homes, and it is a pathetic sight. The cemetery has a big bomb crater, and the coffins are out of the ground. What a sight, but I saw worse the next day when I went with 3 other men to bury a German Officer and a Canadian soldier. I did not mind this unpleasant job, and I need not have gone but some did not like the job so I thought it was only right.</p>
<p>The German Officer had a bad wound in the side, and it was a gruesome task we had to do. The place where they were billeted was bombed to smithereens, and anyone there would have been fortunate to have come out alive. The underground places had most of their belongings left in, and soldiers were ransacking the place. We hunted round for the body of the Canadian, and after a while we found him by a trench. The sight of him was terrible, and I thought to myself, well I'm glad that his people were spared the agony of seeing him. I will not write any more about this, for it is not a pleasant subject. I thought "wars should never again be allowed to start, causing so much misery to everyone". The Bombardier who was with us had the job of identifying him, and he found his paybook, and the name Elliot, joined up in 1943 as a farmer. He was 22 years old, a young life thrown away for the sake of what. I felt sad to think of it all. As we buried him I said a silent prayer to myself, and the words came to me "Man that is born of a Woman has but a short time to live. He cometh up and is cut down like a flower and never continueth in one stay; In the midst of life we are in death, and of whom shall we seek for succour but of thee O Lord, who for our Sins art justly displeased."</p>
<p>We came back to camp, had a wash and then tea. I was on guard at night, the wind was howling, and I wished more than ever I was safely back with Win, but surely it can't be long now. On Sept 26th we saw our Lancasters and Halifaxes bombing <span class="location" data-place-id="calais">Calais</span>, and meeting no opposition. What must <span class="location" data-place-id="calais">Calais</span> be like now. It was a clear day, and I looked across to the White Cliffs. My mind went back to when we were at Margate when we used to look over to the shores of France, and now here I was looking at England again, but through my glasses, and here is our gun site here in a high place we have a good view of the scenery. <span class="location" data-place-id="boulogne">Boulogne</span> itself is a mass of bombs, and it will take years to rebuild. At night we sit and write in the gun emplacements, and with some German gas lamps and candles, sometimes with a drop of paraffin in, we manage to make the place a bit more cheery. But it is not like home, and I think of what I would be doing if it was peace-time. I hear from my loved one regularly- except for a fortnight when the letters were delayed, and I've heard the good news that we have got a house to start our life. I'm happy as Win is, and I guess she was very pleased and thrilled. The day won't come quick enough when we are at last re-united, for I'm looking forward very much to married life. I shan't be sorry to leave the army I detest; only the few real friends I have made I shall miss, such as Frank and Alec. As a gun team it is good, but half of them now are selfish. In this place at night I hear language that isn't nice to hear, and I long for the peace and quietness of a happy home, just Winnie and me, what lovely thoughts.</p>
<p>The opening days of October are none too warm, and since we have been at <span class="location" data-place-id="boulogne">Boulogne</span> the days and nights are very rough. Perhaps its because we are close to the sea. I don't like the nights we do the guards, an hour every other night breaks into the sleep. We have had 4 alarms so far but not any firing. Shall I be glad to get back home again. I often wonder what Win is doing, lonely nights for her. I went out for the first time since being here, at AA OR to see a picture, on the night of Oct 4. The lorry went without Frank and I so we walked the three and a half miles. When we got there the small building which held 250 and some standing at that, couldn't get anyone else in, so we peeped through the back. Well if Win could have seen me, I don't know what she would have said. On the way there we saw a lot of civilians tramping back to what was left of their homes; a pathetic sight. No, there is nothing left of <span class="location" data-place-id="boulogne">Boulogne</span>. On our afternoons off we go across to the bombed out places of Jerry's dug-outs which are underground. All sorts of stuff is there, and the lads are hunting around feverishly. How the Germans lived there is beyond me, for you could hardly breathe. I have found a nice flask, and one or two other odds and ends. But I gave the Germans credit for their building of both gun emplacements and dug-outs. I have seen many prisoners, some mere boys, and the more they capture the better. How I wish this war would end. These cold and windy October nights make me wish I was sitting cosy with Win. I used to love to hear the wind howling when I was back at home, but I have to go out in it now. We have had a few alarms but are not out long.</p>
<p>I went along with Frank on Monday afternoon Oct 9 to a place named <span class="location" data-place-id="desvres">Devres</span> [<span class="location" data-place-id="desvres">Desvres</span>] which lies 10 miles away, and it is also out of bounds for us, but it didn't make any difference to Frank and I, and we got through alright. There were only our own two selves among the troops about, and we were greeted pleasantly. We strolled up the streets noting as much as we could. It is an industrial place I should imagine, for there were a few factory chimneys. We went into a shop to get some cards, but came out without the ones we would have hoped to get. We called into a café, and had a small glass of beer which was sweet. There wasn't much we could do. While we were in there a civilian man came in and spoke a few words in French to the bar keeper, when he suddenly surprised us by saying "How are you going on son", and then started singing "Take me back to dear old Blighty, put me on the train for London town". He told us he had learned a lot of English, back in 1914-1918. After an hours stay we decided to make our way back to camp, Mont Lambert is the name. We joined a RASC lorry coming back. As we walked down one street a shopkeeper came out and called us in. He explained to us that he wanted a letter posting to England. I saw that the address was to Madame Mascherry, 41 Francis Road, Birmingham. He read the letter to us, which was in French, and we had another surprise, for he spoke perfect English. He took us into the front room and gave us a glass of Whisky which he said he had saved for English Soldiers since 1940, hidden away from the Germans. The letter was about his relations in <span class="location" data-place-id="brussels">B'ham</span>. We had the desire to go to the lavatory, and he said "I shall show you where, and I must hang on to my dog" (who was a ferocious looking animal.) He had his teeth at us, and Frank and I were glad he came with us to the back. We found the gentleman very interesting, telling us about how the Germans treated them, going into shops and not paying for articles. He gave us two eggs each and a pound of butter. He said his wife was a Londoner, but she was in bed with a bad knee, and he hoped we would come again on our next afternoon off which is Saturday Oct 14. He was very pleased to see us, and we were too, so we are looking forward to another visit. They would like some washing soap, and I know Win won't mind me taking some that she has sent. I hope we are still here on Saturday for there is a rumour going round that we shall soon be moving. I will write more of our visit when Sunday comes.</p>
<p>Today the 11th we have gone out to the bomb craters to do some rifle shooting, the first time my rifle has been fired since I first had it in May 1943. Saturday the 14th was rainy at first, but the afternoon broke fine so we decided to make the journey of 14 kilometers to <span class="location" data-place-id="desvres">Desvres</span> again. We were fortunate to get a lift in a cattle truck. The road to <span class="location" data-place-id="desvres">Desvres</span> is like a switchback, so many hills, and I stopped walking and said to Frank "I can hear a motor coming" and he said "it's an aeroplane". Five minutes later the aeroplane turned out to be a French cattle truck, with the noisiest engine I've heard. We climbed into the cab, which made 4 in there and I had the unusual experience of sitting on the right hand side of the driver, which wouldn't have been allowed in England. Still we got there alright, and we were cautious as we strolled along the streets, for as I have said this place is out of bounds, but we got to the shop of George Ruffin the friend we had made, and he welcomed us in and told us to make ourselves at home. His wife was up, a frail woman and a Londoner. We found she was stone deaf, the wireless was blaring forth and she sat there listening to the programme. Frank and I soon settled, but we told him we should have to leave before dark, as we didn't fancy the 9 mile walk. They had a piano which was out of tune but Frank soon had the mouth organ going. We took our turns at this with a little sing song between ourselves. George had to shout to make his wife hear, and I felt sorry for them both. He was very capable in the home, doing a lot of the housework besides attending to his business in the shop - a cycle shop by the way. The big mastiff was more friendly with us this time. George then told us he had to go out to get the rations which they have each month, "and you will see what we get" he said. As Frank lives near London, he found Mrs Ruffin interesting, but had to write everything down on paper. George returned with the rations and while he was away he told us we could look at his stamp book. Never have I seen so many different collections of all countries. They made us very welcome, and gave us a good supper of meat and fried potatoes. Did we enjoy it, I'll say we did, but we didn't like eating their meat, for we both thought the same, whether we were robbing them, but I suppose as good friends they would have liked us to have it. 6.30 came, and it started to rain. I said that we should have to be going, so we said our thanks, and made to leave. We had been in his shop from 3 o'clock, and he shook both of our hands, and said he was sorry we could not have stayed longer. The rain abated a little but fortunately we brought our gas capes along with us. After covering a kilo it rained heavily so we went into a café. We hadn't much money in French, for this same day we had to exchange it, pending the move to Belgium. The woman in the café served us with a drink. There were only the two of us in there. She asked me for cigarettes saying she would pay me, but I said No Bon to that, for francs were no use to us, so I pointed to the glasses for her to fill them up and I gave her 10 cigs. On our journey back it rained on and off. We walked 4 kilometers, and thought this is our unlucky night, for not a lorry passed us those 4 kilos. Nearing <span class="location" data-place-id="boulogne">Boulogne</span> Forest we looked back and saw lights. We were sheltering under a yew tree and I said to Frank "If our wives could see us now," and Frank said they would shed a few tears. The lorries turned out to be an American convoy, and the last lorry stopped and asked if it was the way to <span class="location" data-place-id="boulogne">Boulogne</span>. We blessed our luck and had a welcome lift, arriving at camp at 10.30. So ended an enjoyable day. I found a letter from Win on my bed, and I opened it eagerly. Frank also had one, which conveyed the news that his brother-in-law was reported missing, which upset him. What a curse this war has on mankind, and I went to bed thinking of Winnie, and all she means to me.</p>
<p>Next day, we had the order Cease Firing, and while it was raining hard we paddled about the muddy gun site on a Sunday night. What a life I was thinking, detesting everything the Army has done. We worked hard getting guns out of action, and the hundred and one things a move means. Then at 9.30 the TSM came in and told us there would be no bed for us that night, but to pack everything on to the GTV.</p>
<p>Fortunately we had a fire going in this German emplacement, and we sat round most of the night. Breakfast was at 4.30, and the move to our unknown destination was at 6am.</p>
<p>We have travelled 93 miles today October 16, into Belgium. Our GTV broke down 5 miles from the place we were camping out for the night, and just 12 months ago later I find myself under canvas again, the Eve of my birthday. While the GTV was being seen to the people of the house close by invited us in for coffee and bread and butter, an enjoyable meal, for we have been chewing biscuits today. The field we camped in was very wet, but we placed a cover down inside the tent. Dinner was served, and while this was going on a crowd of civilians collected, looking longingly at the food. Corned beef isn't a favourite with the men, and the cooks ask us if we want 3 or 4 pieces. I took the 4, and gave 2 fellows a piece each. A little girl of about 8 years said to me "Tomato for Cigarette", so I soon dealt the necessary, and gave the tomato to Alec who is very fond of them. The kids soon wanted our biscuits, and those that Alec gave them were snatched eagerly from him, making Alec say "They're like a pack of wolves, Och away wi ya". Frank got them singing their national anthem, and it was nice to hear their voices. He asked if I was going out, but I preferred to stay in and get to bed early. I've had some lovely cards from the ones over in England, a lovely one from my Darling Wife, also 2 smashing letters. These letters are everything to me now we are apart.</p>
<p>Next morning we hung about round the place, waiting to move on, which came at 10.30. The civilians were looking on, and seemed very interested in the guns. The next and final part of the journey went smoothly until reaching <span class="location" data-place-id="bruges">Bruges</span>, when the pin snapped, and we were letting them know about the flow. This was another move. I think our firing position has been a mistake, but as it has been visited during the past day we had a good welcome. We are about 2 miles from there, and we parked the guns in a drive leading to a mansion. It reminded me of New Hall Drive. The port of <span class="location" data-place-id="knokke">Knokke</span> lies 8 miles away. Our job here was to do some ground shooting to remove the Germans from their stronghold.</p>
<p>It was on October 17th we arrived, and well I knew it, for it was my birthday and the gale and rain was very bad. Still the job had got to be done of putting the guns into action and we bore it cheerfully although we were wet through. We pitched the tent on the muddy drive, for we had got to have somewhere to sleep. One of the lads managed to get some straw, which made it a lot better and we slept alright. The next day we fired on the target and we are still doing, adopting the role of Field Artillery. After sleeping 2 nights in the tent we found room in the big house. Our food now is hydrated, and plenty of biscuits. The Belgian people speak something like us, and we can understand them better, and they make us welcome. We have done 2 night shoots so far, firing about 30 rounds per gun. There is plenty of noise, but we know the shooting is accurate. One target we fired on was a patrol, and some 88mm guns were fired on. We only hope they do not get our range.</p>
<p>I had my first afternoon off to go out to <span class="location" data-place-id="bruges">Bruges</span>, and we found it a big city with plenty in the shops. I thought of getting something for Win, some stockings priced at 145 francs which is about 17 shillings, rather dear I thought, and they did not look a very good quality. I was along with Frank and Alec. I called in various shops for small items, and going into one I had a job to make them understand I wanted some flints. Yes, their language sure has got us beat sometime. Another shop we went into for some views of the place - she could speak English. Her husband had his box of cigars to us before we came out. We went into the big stores to have a look round and a radiogram was playing "Take me back to dear old Blighty". I wished I was going back. Coming from there we went to a tea shop, but we had to have something to eat. It was getting dark, and I said to Alec "I hope we'll find our way out". We were on our own after leaving Frank who preferred the cafes. We had been to the pictures to see "Alloah", a nice sort of film. It wasn't very plain speaking, and for the sake of the Belgian people the words are flashed on the screen. The seating arrangement is not comfortable, just hard seats like you see in the parks. The price was 10 francs in the Balcony. It seemed strange seeing pictures here after England. When we came out it was raining heavily and we got wet when arriving at camp. Still we had had a good afternoon, and better still we hadn't to turn out that night for action. We find it tiring these late nights, being called on for a couple of hours or so. So far we have fired 207 rounds in 10 days and nights up to the 28th October. A guard comes round every 4 nights, 4 hours, and have to do manning as well. The shooting is accurate with good results. Our role of Anti Aircraft has not been needed since leaving <span class="location" data-place-id="crepon">Crepon</span>. We are lucky in having a house for billets. We are better off than F Troop, who are under canvas, as well as water. I have travelled again to <span class="location" data-place-id="bruges">Bruges</span>, and another nice outing. I went along with Alec.</p>
<p>As the days go by I think more and more of Win, wishing I was with her again. When that time comes I shall be very happy. These autumn days and nights are cold now, and I often wonder if that is hope I would be out of the army before winter sets in. I shan't be disappointed I hope. I am longing for a reunion, for to even go over for 7 days would be something. The nights go slow and there isn't much to do. We haven't been out since coming here on Nov 2nd. I do not care much about barrack room atmosphere, and wish for the comfort of a cosy home. A haze of smoke hangs about and there are far too many in the barn making it unhealthy. It is refreshing to go out next morning to breathe the sea air. It blows strong from the water and we gaze across at the ships that are now going through. Minesweepers are clearing the channels and soon <span class="location" data-place-id="antwerp">Antwerp</span> will be in full swing. We have been called out occasionally but no firing. One night recently we had the old familiar shout of "Target Predictor Control" and followed the course of the plane, which turned out to be a Liberator, which when held in the Searchlights dropped its recognition colours. Some days we watch our Lancasters go over in force, and not such a great height. There isn't a lot to do in the day time, though nearly every day is nothing but rain. I have had good news of Winnie and I feel more content after having the welcome letters to know she is recovering.</p>
<p>As November opens, it still finds us here, firing away at <span class="location" data-place-id="knokke">Knokke</span>, where Jerry hangs on. We have been called on several times during nights and days, with good results from the shooting, setting fire to his ammo dump, and destroying their gun positions. I am thankful there's been no retaliation. Ammunition pours in to us, and we're either handling that, or making blast walls. There is a café on the corner of the drive where the lads go for a quick one. Two nice elderly people run the place. Sometimes during the mornings I go in for a glass of stout, which is rather nice. Frank says "Are you getting your back up". I play a game of Billiards with him. It's also nice to sit round the stove in there. By the way, their firegrates of the Belgians <em>(sic)</em> are boarded in, and they have a stove with wood as fuel, for they have no coal. The houses are clean and nice, and they are a friendly race, making us welcome. I enjoy the comfort of the fire, and as I sit there during the working hours the guard at the drive end rushes in and says "Take Posts" which means we have to run to our gun 60 yards away, but quite handy. We then get from the Tannoy, which is an instrument with wires fixed running from the house where the orders come from, "Ground Target". A bearing QE and Fuze are given and they order 3 or more rounds gun fire. I don't mind this at all, as I sit on the bearing seat and go to the bearing ordered. The gun jumps every time, like a bucking bronco, and Frank who sits on the elevation seat says "the old gel is having too much corn". After a lot of firing we stand easy inside the tent, which comes in useful from the rain day and night. We usually know at 3.30 each night what time we will fire, and it is always between 12 and 5am. The alarm goes, and as Frank and I dress hurriedly we think, if only you women could see us, rushing out into the night at all hours. I feel tired towards afternoon. Children are around the guns, but soon run when we fire. They have got used to the noise by now. Bernard Belsham has the loan of a camera, so we have had taken photos of our gun team. They have turned out alright. Tomorrow November 2nd I shall be going on the recce party to another place. The rumour is <span class="location" data-place-id="antwerp">Antwerp</span>.</p>
<p>The morrow dawns, and we are up at 5, breakfast is at 5.30, and we move off to an unknown destination at 7am. We go a long way round and after a few hours journey we come to a place named <span class="location" data-place-id="goes">Goes</span>. There we stop and brew up some tea, and have biscuits and corned beef. We proceed on our way, having left Belgium behind. At 3.30 we reach a lonely spot, <span class="location" data-place-id="zuid_beveland">South Beueland</span> is the name, [<span class="location" data-place-id="zuid_beveland">Zuid Beveland</span>] and we stay in a big granary, where the Germans had been stationed. Still it was a roof over our heads. The place had bags of corn and cabbage seed in it, but as we had only 6 on the recce we found a nice dry spot by the bags of wheat. The shed was riddled with shrapnel and bullet holes in places. Young Ivor Jones and I cleaned a place out ready for the cooks to cook a meal when they came along. I had grown to like young Jones ever since <span class="location" data-place-id="southampton">Southampton</span> days, one of the few Welsh lads I thought was decent. We have had tea together here. I claimed a place for Frank so we have a corner of this spacious shed, which is very cold, and about the best place is under the blankets these cold nights. The guns came along about 2 hours afterwards, which were not put into action until night time. We had a supper, and next day Nov 4 we drew the guns along the dyke in front of the sea, a very bleak spot. Remaining the old recce crew blast wall was almost completed when our officers were visited by the Engineers who created a row, because we had dug in, which was a danger because of the sea lapping giving way and flooding the surrounding flat country. I was called on to help bury an Artillery man washed up on the shore, a young man of about 28. I said a silent prayer for him. I was sad, thinking what misery war causes to their home people. He was an Unknown Soldier.</p>
<p>Next day we moved the guns on to the top of the bank. The weather is cold and showery and some of us have cheeks like roses. I am glad when tea time comes, if only to get out of the wind. I was on guard on Wednesday night November 8 from 11 to 1. I had come in, and had a drink of tea, got nicely settled, when the alarm went, and out we went on our first action call. It was 2 o'clock before we came in. We did not fire. At about 12.30 the same night I was with Frank Parsons, and Tom Duggan from <span class="location" data-place-id="brussels">B'ham</span> on guard together. We heard a plane then we said it was hostile, being 12000 yards away. Another alarm went again next night at 8.30 for half an hour. I had got to bed early, as I was tired, and was soon asleep. I hastily dressed, I was all of a tremble when going outside, the wind howled, and a bit of the moon was showing. I thought of Win, and wished I was in a cosy bed. I hadn't been feeling very well for a day or two, having had a cold. I was hoping to have stayed in to have had a good night's sleep. We have a drop of rum most nights, and we have had some alarms, 6 one night in 1 hour, running in and out. I have seen our planes going over to Germany and it is a great sight.</p>
<p>It is the 29th November now, another fill Christmas and I hope it will be the last in this country. The future with Winnie, a happy home and our wonderful Love which will always be the same. I'm happy now to know we are married and I know Winnie will feel the same.</p>
<p>It is Sunday now, December 31st Every now and then I write a few pages in this book of events. Nothing much has happened, except that I went on a journey 13 Kilometers from France to fetch some wood for Nissen sheets. The ships have started to come through and we see them to place out guns at 6.30. Tonight I'm on guard from 9 to 11. It is a rough night, makes me wish I was sitting in our cosy home. I do long for always. In this barrack room there is a wireless which brightens the atmosphere a lot. "Yours" "Jealousy" and "Our Blue Heaven".</p>
<p>December weather is just the same as November, all rain. Plenty of water and mud about the fields of Holland. We are thankful we have a decent place. I went with a few others to <span class="location" data-place-id="goes">Goes</span>. The house we went to was in a room. We had a job getting downstairs, for the householder had locked a door from the inside and left the key in the lock so we couldn't get in. Christmas has come and gone, and New Years Day brought us excitement. We had plenty of action as we chased the enemy up and down the searchlights at target, and before we could get a fuse it was gone out of our reach again, but it turned out to be Mosquito returning from Germany.</p>
<p>New Years morning found 9 enemy aircraft in the area, FW's, and ME's. An ME 109 roared over the guns, and had again no luck. I was on duty but had got no satisfaction for the guns either, and had given a long chase up to ME109 for all he was worth. Fire had been ordered and I got the plane through the open sights. It was a misfire - and our chance had gone with the ME109.</p>
<p>No 3 gun had a lovely shot, and the plane was in trouble. It crashed near. The spotter on duty identified them as ME262's, but others said they were Mitchells. The ME262 was a German plane twin jet, called them the Butterfly. Mitchell was a Canadian plane. On a few other nights we have been called out. I wish it was over. I'm thinking every day now that we shall settle down together.</p>
<p>On the day arrived, and I'm all excited at going on leave. I pack my everything, and on the morning of Thursday we travelled along. First we went to RHQ, and from there to Calvers. I went from there to Deptford where the trolley bus arrived at Euston, and arrived home at 11.30. Winnie was in by herself, and I shall never forget the thrill I had when I saw her still looking lovely. We spent another very happy leave. The train had hard seats and no heating. What a journey it was, my feet were like ice blocks. I thought some day soon we shall be together for always. The journey back was more comfortable. I had the good fortune to have a 24hrs extension while on leave.</p>
<p>I arrived back at camp on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Well here I am back at camp trying to settle down, and watching for my first letters from my Loved One. I hadn't long to wait for one came on the following Sunday. When I answered it I sent her a picture of myself in my new kit at <span class="location" data-place-id="middelburg">Middleburg</span> [<span class="location" data-place-id="middelburg">Middelburg</span>], which helped to pass another day away. A week later we had a little excitement when we received orders to strike camp, and so we started to do the next morning, when 18 Bakers flew low over the site, startling everyone.</p>
<p>The days of February are drawing to a close. Frank and Alec are back off leave. I have my Dutch friends I mentioned above, and each night after tea I go along to the barn which is full of smoke. My eyes ache and I wish I was back home. Another place I go to is a shed that looks like a barn where the Dutchman's cattle are. There is not much excitement here nowadays. We see crowds of planes going over, which reminds me I forgot to say that the day I got back from leave, and got a good close up of it. I had been to <span class="location" data-place-id="brussels">Brussels</span> on Sunday February for a 48 hours and while I was there the air raid warning went on a few times, flying bombs were the cause and the All clear soon went. I stayed in the Albert Hotel. I went on a conducted tour of the city. To hear some of the men talk here of their sexual experiences at the brothels was shocking. Some of them said they had the chance of good. I was glad I had the resolve to stay right from straying. I would never forgive myself if I went off the straight path. I think too much of Winnie.</p>
<p>March is here now, and into the second week. We are enjoying lovely sunny days. Spring is in the air. I hope that long before next Spring I am home. There is not much doing in the battery, the odd fire order to do and nothing more. We still need a fire however and we have no difficulty in finding wood. So we find the fields with plenty of quite hanging posts at intervals. Sometimes in the barn we gather around a fire, and discuss what we are going to do. When it's my night off I go down with Frank to the Dutchman's house which is next to home to us. We have fired the gun again. That particular morning of March was a chilly one. Sentries had been on duty all through the night and day. About 2pm over in large numbers. The rockets are still being sent over leaving a trail of white behind. One night Frank and I were returning from our friend's house and I stopped and said to Frank "is that a fire?" He was puzzled and said "No that isn't no fire, just a rocket." We have a night off now every 5 or 6 nights, and we spend it in the Barn. We have a wireless set belonging to a REME fellow. Sometimes an ENSA comes on, a picture show.</p>
<p>Strange to see the surroundings; washing and gear hanging about the barn, but the show goes and is appreciated and commented upon afterwards.</p>
<p>Today March 29th I saw a Lancaster come down. In the morning we had been returning when I noticed one at about 3,000 ft with a trail of smoke behind. It was returning and I looked on. I did not see it strike myself, but somebody was recovered and taken to hospital. They say it smashed right into the wood below. Being in the smoke the crew came down like that. I went over afterwards to see if I could see any pieces. We are not allowed to travel much unless we carry permits which is a pity. The Dutchman is employed with us. To-day we went to a town, very interesting. I noticed it was lovely and sunny. I suppose soon we shall be moving up the Rhine. At night we see the rockets go up and can follow them for about 100 secs. I looked at a rocket go up, a real sight which we followed for 6 minutes. Well I can state that it is only a matter of seconds and it has vanished into the night – a good view from the clear.</p>
<p>I went to a show given for the people on Easter Monday to a few miles away from camp. I came back through a little village on the way. We went down to where the Lancaster came down and all that remains is a mass of tangled metal.</p>
<p>April has come in and the days now are warm. The Easter weekend was dull and rather cold but these days, April 1st and onwards, are very warm. A rumour goes through the camp that we are to go to a firing camp to try out the new equipment that has come. I can't think why the Government has bought this expensive gear at this stage of the war, for I feel sure that the end of April or early in May will see the finish.</p>
<p>The rumour turned out to be true, for on Saturday April 14th at 5.30 we packed up. It was intended that after a week we should be coming back so a few things were left behind. We started off at 5.45 and travelled along on this warm night enjoying the scenery of the Dutch countryside. A great change has come over it, for the trees and blossoms in the gardens look a glorious sight. We parked in the grounds of a big house just outside <span class="location" data-place-id="antwerp">Antwerp</span> for the night, and we weren't long in rigging up the tent. Some of the men went out to the cafes. It was 8 o'clock and after a supper of soup I went to bed. Rain fell slightly for about two hours, but our tent was brand new, different from some of the others, where the water came in.</p>
<p>Next morning the 15th April we resumed our journey, with the temperature round about 70 degrees it was quite nice. Nothing happened to the GTV or the gun while travelling, but a tyre burst on No 3 gun. We arrived at <span class="location" data-place-id="nieuport">Nieuport</span> 10 miles from Ostende on Sunday night the 15th. We were stationed in a big school, and we were fortunate in having wooden beds, although Frank and I had one with ordinary wire netting for a spring. Every movement in the night sets up a creaking sound, bringing comments from the other men, 18 of us in this room. Monday morning came, and we took the guns to a drill shed for our much-in-the-news job of Care and Maintenance. No 1 and No 2 guns were taken to the firing position, and they had silent practice while we cleaned away at the gun. It was a long morning for we had got up at 6 o'clock, and away to the guns at 8 o'clock. We had finished about 2.30 in the afternoon. I had to go through a Fuse Prediction Test, along with Jack Sutton and other No 4's from other guns. The rest of the day was easy for we returned to billets, and Frank and I walked into <span class="location" data-place-id="nieuport">Niewport</span> for a shower and bath. At night I went to a picture show, but in there was like a hothouse. The picture show was called "The Way We Live" featuring Frederick March. I didn't think much of it, so Alec who I was with said "Let's get out", so we went to a canteen and spent a negligible evening. Frank had gone down to Ostende on the usual visit to his girl. At 10 o'clock I had to go through the Fuse Prediction Test again that night for about an hour, and had to show the parts of the gun, and the Battery's quota in such an event of movement. I was quite amused for about an hour when Sgt Morris came in at twenty minutes to twelve and told us all to get out of bed, for Cease Firing had come through, and we wondered what was going to happen. Whether we were going to do some field shooting farther in Holland was a question we were asking ourselves. Anyway out we got and were taken up to the drill shed about 2 miles away to get the guns out of action. This took us altogether about an hour, and finally we got to bed the second time that night at 1 45.</p>
<p>We moved off to an unknown destination next morning at 8.45 and travelled the same way as we had come. We came to a place named Kappelín [<span class="location" data-place-id="kapelle">Kappelin</span>] 8 miles from <span class="location" data-place-id="antwerp">Antwerp</span> and there we were told that we were finished with ack-ack. All the guns were going to be handed in. This was Tuesday April 17th, our final finish. It came as a sort of shock, for we didn't think anything would happen like this. But here we are in these buildings waiting to see what is going to happen. It is rumoured that we are going as occupation troops, but I take all I hear with a pinch of salt. I know they've not been long in sorting us out for fatigues, for we are going down each day to an aerodrome a mile outside <span class="location" data-place-id="antwerp">Antwerp</span>. There is a graveyard of the 3.7's and Bofor guns, also some of the new equipment that we never used. Our job is to grease every working part, a sticky job, our hands covered in the oil C70, C600. GS Grease, and mineral jelly. The REME men, who are in charge, see that the job is done properly. After we cover all working parts with grease, they come round and point out the places we have missed. Sunday April 22nd was a cold, stormy day, not a day for a job like this. There are a few hundred guns on this aerodrome, and the Battery's quota is 36, but these have been done and now we are on the Bofors, guns we've never had anything to do with and there's more work on these, for the Barrels and Breech blocks have to be taken out. In time they are going back to England. I have seen planes and have been inside a Liberator and Dakota and have looked around a Thunderbolt and Mustang. In the Dakota there are 28 seats, so you can imagine the size. There is also a Fortress on the Drome which made a forced landing, with its fuselage smashed. Mechanics were working on another Fortress, and repairing an engine. The other 3 were started up, and broke into a powerful roar. Our job here starts at 8.30 and continues till 5 o'clock. I have missed one day, but I was sent out to a Mixed Heavy AA site to work there. We are spreading cinders on a track, a racing track for the Sports, and building up the site ready for the Belgians after the war. It is said that it will be a practice camp for them.</p>
<p>Before we had this job on the aerodrome I went along to <span class="location" data-place-id="antwerp">Antwerp</span> swimming baths, and I enjoyed the splash. The weather is very warm, apart from last Sunday and Monday 22 and 23. Today April 26th we had a parade in best battle dress to go to an address given by the GOC AA. He spoke to us about our Regt the 113th being disbanded, there was no further use for AA, but thanked us for the work we had done. A week after the Colonel had us all in the big room of F Troop and told us the "pitiful" story of the Regt being disbanded, as if we cared. He must have thought we liked the army. He gave me the impression that he was disappointed that the war was nearing its close. I daresay Army life suited him after being in as long as he has. It isn't in him, not one bit, but I consider it bad to be that I came in. My greatest wish is to be home again and that day will not come quick enough. We are thinking every day now of saying goodbye to this kind of life and to rid it off.</p>
<p>The weekend of May 5th and 6th brought some exciting news, for it was announced that Victory Day would be before Thursday. On the Sunday night the 6th I went down on a tram to the Church of Scotland canteen. I wrote a letter in there. The scenery round about is lovely, and I enjoy the quietness. I was in high spirits on this warm May evening, and I walked back along the main road leading from <span class="location" data-place-id="antwerp">Antwerp</span> to Kappelín (<span class="location" data-place-id="kapelle">Kappelle</span>) with its avenue of trees. The birds were singing away as if they knew that Victory would soon be here. Next day I went to the site again for fatigues, and at 6 o'clock it was announced that the next day the 8th and 9th of May would be VE days. As we had been expecting this great news for days it didn't come as a shock. But all the same we were excited. Monday was another warm night and the room was warm too making sleep impossible for a while. The sirens sounded soon after midnight and kept up their continuous wails for 20 minutes. Next day dawned sultry and it wasn't long before the rain came. It stopped before dawn so Alec and I went to <span class="location" data-place-id="antwerp">Antwerp</span> to see the "sights". In a letter to Win I have described what took place, so will not bother writing more of it. I was feeling none too good with the heat of the afternoon, the sun blazing down from a cloudless sky, so we went back early. The two days were free so we lazed about and went out for a stroll at night. Now that the end has come I feel more unsettled but I suppose patience will be rewarded some near day in the future. Each day that comes sees someone being posted out to where I go isn't decided yet. Some have gone to a driver training Regt already. Oh, I do wish I was going home. It is at these weekends that I think more of home life and what we should be doing. The letters I have are something very precious, and I look forward eagerly to them. The weather is warm and close now, and Alec and I go for a walk through the woods in a large estate. It is pleasant there, and the Rhododendrons look lovely. How I wish I was along with Win, she would enjoy the scenery as much as I. The scent from the various flowers is lovely and sweet. To hear the birds singing - nightingales and thrushes - is a joy that I wouldn't miss for worlds. On Saturday 12th May we were coming back from our usual walk - it would be 10.30 - and we stopped to listen to the nightingales sing.</p>
<p>Last night the 13th May, it was just after tea when from the streets of <span class="location" data-place-id="kapelle">Kappelin</span> [<span class="location" data-place-id="kapelle">Kapelle</span>] came the sounds of music. I went to the upstairs room opposite and from there I saw something which was strange. A crowd of people numbering six or seven hundred were going along following the music leaders and stopping at the houses of the collaborators, and ransacking the place. They were throwing all the belongings from the windows, furniture, beds, and everything that was inside. The signs of the Swastika were on these houses. This is how I saw the sight. A man would burst open the door or windows and two or three would go in and throw the stuff to the waiting crowd. It was really looting. From one shop came silk stockings, handkerchiefs and fountain pens and cotton. Then from a bedroom came the beds and clothes, and even tins of peas and fish. Bernard Belsham was along with the crowd, on the scrounge as usual, and from what he said he was with a girl who could speak English, and she said they deserved all they were getting. It appeared that these people whose houses were being ransacked were with the Nazis, and even went against their own families. The Mayor used to sanction the sons being sent to Germany, so his house was shown no mercy. They gave the collaborators 48 hours to quit. They were taking the law into their own hands after the Justices of the Peace failed to do anything about it. Right or wrong it was about the maddest thing I've seen. Eager hands were reaching up for the things from the windows, and a woman took fruit from the baskets which were there, and then the men would throw more. From the way she was speaking the leader smashed a window in, and a woman looked upset. From what she was saying it looked as though she was in the right. The crowd had taken the wrong house, but no harm was done apart from the broken window. It reminded me of these pictures where there are things broken up. We did not watch long, for we went a walk through the woods again. I have received some news tonight May 13th that I am going away with three others to a transit camp in <span class="location" data-place-id="berlin">Berlin</span> within a day or so. Yes, I expect I shall see a few more sights before I'm safely home with Win. While I've been writing I've had my shirt off, as it's warm in the room.</p>
<p>May 23rd finds me writing a bit more. Much has happened since the 13th. I received orders that I would be going away on Wednesday 16th. My last night was spent with Alec and we walked about 6 miles through the woods and common enjoying the quietness and peace and the birds singing. It was a treat to hear the nightingales. We both felt disappointed at the thought of leaving each other's company. Next morning I received many handshakes, all saying the best of luck and take care of yourself. It somehow brought back memories of leave partings at home, and I did feel the occasion a lot, after being with these men for so many years. But I'm looking forward to the great day when I get out of the army, to a lovely home life. It means everything to me now. I left with a man I had known since Oswestry days; but I wished Frank and Alec were the ones who would be coming with me.</p>
<p>We started our journey at 10.30 to call for one or two other men, and we arrived at a place called <span class="location" data-place-id="namur">Namur</span> in Belgium. It was a Yankee place, but they sent us back to another town called <span class="location" data-place-id="louvain">Louvain</span> [or <span class="location" data-place-id="louvain">Leuven</span>], also in Belgium. What a mix up, the usual army one. So now we are in the Schools for an indefinite time awaiting further instructions. It is said it is to the <span class="location" data-place-id="berlin">Berlin</span> district we are bound and that is the address we have got. Letters are delayed, the result of the move. My job now is General Duties. Guards, Telephone and Cookhouse so far has been my lot. I wonder if I shall meet anyone I know. Already there is one from Alrewas near Tamworth. I shall get used to the new men, and each day is one nearer home. I've been out most nights, walking around <span class="location" data-place-id="louvain">Louvain</span>, which is a fair sized place. On Sunday the 20th May I was along with two other men, and we came across civilians dancing in the streets, the music playing "Tipperary" which seems the only tune they know. The days pass pretty slow, and I feel unsettled, longing to get back home. At the same time I am thankful that the war is over. I spend most days in the cookhouse. Still, I'd rather stay in this town than go to Germany. I'm not keen on that at all. I have two letters addressed to the 391/113 which have been sent here. Every other day we are duty men, either peeling potatoes, or working on the Ablutions Sanitary and sweeping up. After a week went by I didn't have to go to the cookhouse as other new cooks came in, so now I either do the work of sanitary along with another man, or ablutions, which doesn't take too long. We are not having a hard time as yet. At night we go to the pictures and already I've palled up with Bill Darby, who comes from near Burton. We go about together a lot, to the cinemas, four all told, and a Theatre which gives good entertainment. <span class="location" data-place-id="louvain">Louvain</span> is knocked about from the results of war. Still it's not a bad place, and I think each day is one nearer home. What pleasant thoughts I have of what the word "Home" means to Win and I.</p>
<p>At times when I close my mind goes back to a year ago, the last day in May, and that pleasant day in Spring. And now once again here it is, the evening is warm and pleasant, it is England to me, and Win's looking so peaceful. I think each day is one nearer Home. What pleasant thoughts I have of what the word "Home" means to Win and I.</p>
<p>May and June each time in some ways have been a sad time. I am glad May is gone. I hear there has been a service on the beaches at <span class="location" data-place-id="arromanches">Arromanches</span>. I would have liked to have been there, and as it is I can picture in my mind the beaches once again. The day was to have been free, but a Brigadier was expected to come. We have been busy cleaning up the big school, so we are to have tomorrow off instead. The lads have been cutting the cards to see who is going to be the unlucky two to fetch their breakfast, but I've dropped out from this and declined to get up and get my own. Anyway I shall be awake at 7. Nearly every morning since we've been here the cooks have brought us morning tea in bed, a nice treat which we appreciate, not having been used to it. My biggest anxiety now is that no letters have come for days, and I feel worried, not knowing how Win and all at home are going on. Enquiries are being made but that's how far they get. I hope they will come soon.</p>
<p>At last I am able to say the letters have come, 18 all told, and I was pleased. I feel heaps better. As I write now it is Sunday June 17th. I have been out for a walk away from the town, and I've enjoyed it in a way. I know I miss Win more and more. I hear good news of leave, that any day might easily bring a surprise. We are still taking things easy here in <span class="location" data-place-id="louvain">Louvain</span>, going out at night to a picture or the Garrison Theatre, and we've seen some good shows. There is a Cockney fellow here who now and again shouts "we shan't be round tomorrow, the Donkey's dead". One night at the pictures he shouted this out. I don't know what the people think, I'm sure. I've noticed a change in the civilians just lately, for it seems to us that they would like to see the back of us. Maybe it is our fancy, but I've noticed that when on our way down the street we say "Good Evening" and they don't answer. Really I haven't seen much signs of starving in Belgium, the people look well enough and their dress is good. There is plenty of paint and perfume around.</p>
<p>I went on a fatigue the other day near <span class="location" data-place-id="brussels">Brussels</span>, and I called in on one of the lads from <span class="location" data-place-id="middleton">Middleton</span>, Bill Allsop. I gave him a surprise. The driver of the Vehicle had had a letter from his sister asking him if he would find her husband's grave and photograph it. We went to one cemetery but failed to find the grave. Since then he has been successful. He borrowed a camera from one of the men. I have been to many shows while at <span class="location" data-place-id="louvain">Louvain</span> for I know we shan't see much in Germany. Sunday night the 17th June we decided, my pal and I, to go for a walk as it was too warm for the pictures, so we got away about two miles from <span class="location" data-place-id="louvain">Louvain</span>, and had a sit down on the grass. I noticed a beetle on the road, an insect I had never seen before. So seeing a civilian coming down I asked him what sort it was, and he said "Colorado", and showed us his allotment that was practically destroyed by these dreaded colorado beetles. The potatoes had been sprayed as a safety measure but on one patch the creatures were crawling. He told us the Bock had brought them. We got back at 9.30 and had our usual snack from the cookhouse which is left open, so we do alright for tea. There is an old fellow here who is caretaker for the civilian food and he comes in for a chat each night. He knows a bit of English, and talks in a deep voice. I don't think I've seen such a jolly fellow, and nimble, and he surprised us when he said he was 60. He will say to one cook "You, café, promenade with mademoiselle?", "no F------good ay", "You plenty jig a jug". Well, he's a good nightcap and makes us laugh, but I bet he'll miss us when we leave.</p>
<p>Our move came on the morning of Thursday June 21, and we left <span class="location" data-place-id="louvain">Louvain</span> at 6am arriving at 4.30. We passed through Diest [Diesel] and a few other small places but I can't give you the names now. The driver said "You will see a sign 'You are at the German Frontier". As we crossed in you could somehow tell there was a big difference in the countryside. It reminded me of England. The people had gloomy looks on their faces and would look at us riding in the back of the lorries and turn away again. There is an order out for British and American troops that there is to be no fraternising, so you can imagine how it was with us, after having gone through other countries and being able to speak. We travelled along, enjoying the countryside, and the woodlands were nice to look on. It was different though when we came to small places and towns. There was destruction everywhere. The places <span class="location" data-place-id="wesel">Wesel</span> and Münster were a heap of rubble. Great locomotives were tipped up on end and railway carriages were burnt out, buildings a mass of twisted metal and steel. When we crossed the Rhine we saw the bridges down, and this one was erected by the Royal Engineers, a wonderful job this and the one of the railway bridge. The cooks wagon broke down after crossing the bridge, and we went on without food. It amazes me the brains they have sometimes in the army, for they should have transferred the bulk of the rations to other lorries, so the result of not doing this was that we never had any food until 7.30 at night when we arrived at <span class="location" data-place-id="brunswick">Brunswick</span>. I had a bar of chocolate which I shared with two men who were travelling in the same vehicle. I had a terrible headache at night when we got to <span class="location" data-place-id="brunswick">Brunswick</span>.</p>
<p>We stayed here for a week or more, having broken the journey at <span class="location" data-place-id="bielefeld">Biefield</span> [<span class="location" data-place-id="bielefeld">Bielefeld</span>], stayed there two nights and slept on the floor. This was a German Barracks, and there were fleas in the room. At <span class="location" data-place-id="brunswick">Brunswick</span> we had the same sort of barracks, so seeing one of these big buildings you've seen them all. There was no cooking accommodation available, as there were other Regiments in, practising for the march past <span class="location" data-place-id="berlin">Berlin</span>. Those few days I spent at <span class="location" data-place-id="brunswick">Brunswick</span> were occupied by building outdoor cooking places of bricks and mud, also an Aldershot Oven which when you light a fire conserves heat, and from what I have seen it is a good idea.</p>
<p>On the morning of Tuesday 26th June I had a happy surprise, for the RSM told me I would be going on leave, so next morning I got packed up, but a mistake had been made and I found I was going on Friday the 29th. I do not need to write how I spent my leave, but it was 11 days of happiness that I fully enjoyed. It is heart-breaking having to come back, leaving Win all by herself. It is a terrible feeling and only those who have experienced it know just what it's like. My journey back took four days, staying at <span class="location" data-place-id="dover">Dover</span> the first night, then a night on the train, one at <span class="location" data-place-id="hanover">Hanover</span> and Osnabrick, which should be before <span class="location" data-place-id="hanover">Hanover</span>.</p>
<p>Arriving at <span class="location" data-place-id="berlin">Berlin</span> I felt strange, having no idea where my unit was stationed. I stood a while in the street and noticed a sign 'Transit Camp'; so I found them in ten minutes. I was surprised to find we had got a good billet, a big house with five flats. I have a good spring bed and mattress, that without a doubt is the best yet I've had in the army. I felt the hard blow coming back from home life, and leaving Win again. I feel bitter against the army, after so long of a life I hate. We are not doing much here and I'm sure I could be doing more good out of it, now the war is finished, but I suppose I shall have to stick it out. The German civilians do a lot of the work here, but they don't mind that, for they look forward to handing in the food, which is scarce in <span class="location" data-place-id="berlin">Berlin</span>. The troops do a lot of trade with cigarettes and you see many soldiers with cameras. I have a beauty myself, for I got it cheap in <span class="location" data-place-id="berlin">Berlin</span>, for a bar of chocolate, a few English button-sticks and a small torch, some odds of little value that I have no use for. I have no interest in their goings on, but some of the chaps here are eager for strolls with the frauleins. I have no interest and will stand by my pledge to keep to the straight path, which I've been successful in doing. I know it is a great temptation to a man going without female company, but a married man has no rights to go about with girls. I see plenty of carryings on, but they can do as they please. All I look forward to is Win and a happy home life, so I'll remain faithful and true.</p>
<p>At night I go out with Bill for a stroll into the outskirts of this city, and it is very pleasant. I have seen the great Olympic Stadium here, and have also been sight-seeing. Ruin is the word I describe, for this big city has taken some punishment. As we went along one day in a lorry I smelt the whiff of dead people buried in the ruins. There must be hundreds of bodies in these buildings, which can never be recovered. Bill and I were out one night on our usual stroll, and as we were going down one street a civilian said "Could you please give me a pipe of tobacco". Then one night in the park I saw another man with one leg. He had crutches and I felt sorry for him when he asked for "Tobac", so I gladly gave him some. Most days you hear of hard luck stories, and if you sympathised too much you would be going short yourself. We must not forget what this nation has caused, and I never go out of my way to speak to people, they must speak first, for I had occasionally said Good Evening and got no reply. Bill is away on leave now so I haven't been out a lot, except for a ride out to the <span class="location" data-place-id="southend">Southend</span> NAAFI, to the Church of Scotland Canteen and to the pictures on August Sunday night. I went along with a chap from Wolverhampton, and the picture showing was called "The True Glory". The ban is lifted now on our carrying small arms, so it is more pleasant not having to carry a rifle. I am on guard duties every day now while Bill is away, and as I stood outside the door one morning a woman and a man came along with some books, cowboy ones and a couple of ordinary reading books. She said "I thought you might like them and I do not want cigarettes for the small books but would for the big ones". I hadn't any on me at the moment but another lad went up to fetch some. While he was gone she was talking to me and asked what I thought of <span class="location" data-place-id="berlin">Berlin</span>. I told her I had seen several parts of it. She said <span class="location" data-place-id="berlin">Berlin</span> was once a lovely city, but "Alles Kaput" due to the bombing. I said some of our cities were the same and war never did anyone any good. She asked if I was married and if I had any children, and then said the food problem was difficult in <span class="location" data-place-id="berlin">Berlin</span>. "I expect your dinner will soon be ready and I shall have a job to prepare one for ourselves. Our baby cries in the night for something to eat, but what can we do?" I said it was hard luck and hoped as time went on things would get better. I should like to have asked her many things and told her some, but I was on duty and not supposed to converse with people. Our officer gave me a look as he passed by into the house. I have a certain amount of sympathy for the older people and the kids who do not have much say in the war. But there it is, our country has suffered the same and the German people have been the cause of us being in the army. When these two left me the woman said "Goodbye and the best of luck to you and your family." Previous to this she said she had lived in Kent and her English was quite good. I was left with mixed feelings and again I thought what misery war brings to all countries, and I dread to think what would have become of us if the Germans had won.</p>
<p>Outside again civilians pace up and down, watching our soldiers with their eyes on the ground, picking up cigarette ends. They have lost their respect, but I suppose they are bound to do so. As I strolled out Bill was near and I gave him some cigarettes; he brought me a couple more. Months should see us safely and happily together. We had a surprise one morning when I awoke and saw how light the room was. I looked around and saw flames leaping across the road. The yard was on fire. We removed the lorries from danger and the fire engine came half an hour after, when the old sheds had almost burnt down. A press photographer was there, but the photos didn't turn out as expected. A few days went by and another fire was "staged" for the purpose of photos. The sheds on the opposite side were set on fire, by the use of a jerrican of petrol. The fire engine was there for practice. I've never seen such madness, to deliberately set fire to good wood that could either be used for the cooks' fire, or the civvy's. I was on duty two mornings after when a woman walked into the yard picking up some burnt pieces of wood, till a Sgt here told me to send her away. As far as I'm concerned the civvies could take the lot, and this army does such senseless things that it makes me wonder if they will ever get rid of their silly ideas.</p>
<p>Bill and I were in the park, well it's called a park, but in there is a cemetery where the civilians are buried, dying off in large numbers every day. One night August 22nd we took our usual stroll and sat down on a bench in the park. A man and a woman came along and they looked at us as if they would like to sit down by us, and we moved for them to sit down. I offered them a cigarette, to which the man replied in good English "Thank you very much. You are kind". He asked us what we thought of <span class="location" data-place-id="berlin">Berlin</span>. He went on to tell us how he had learned English several years ago in Switzerland, but as he had had no conversation he would find it difficult to speak now. The woman showed us some photographs of the family, and one with a girl and baby. She said it was their daughter. The man said "our daughter lies over there". She died of a broken heart and lack of food and her husband was killed in Russia. We felt sorry for them. We had a long talk on different subjects, and he spoke as if Germany had had all the suffering, but I told him a few things of what our own country had suffered. The man said Germany would be better if they were under British rule at the start. You have free speech and a King rules you, but you must understand that Germany is in two parts, one Nazi, and the other democratic, and no freedom of speech. He went on to say that the Russians looted, but never mentioned that their countrymen did the same thing only a few years ago. His wife kept talking in German and the man said "My wife demands (it was always "demands") that we would like you to come to our house some night" We said it was against the rules for the British to visit German houses. "we have seen English Soldatens visit houses", then we said it was their risk, and we would be punished if the Military Police saw us. We haven't seen much of them since, for I think it better not to get too friendly. It is not for us to hate, but to understand something about them you have to speak with them. The words of George Ruffin came back to me more than twelve months ago when he said "Do not trust the Germans, they are bad through and through. Do not visit their houses, or drink their water". I could not take to these people like the French, Belgians or Dutch. Some day I shall be leaving Germany, and the sooner that day comes the better. On Friday night I had a big disappointment for it was announced that 23 Group only would be out this year. It is a hard blow for me, and all the others who had banked on the certainty of being out this year. I have honestly thought my Group number would be out by December. I am very disappointed, and I know Winn will be too. The days drag, especially in the hot sun in my guard. I think too much standing there, and seeing no leave men go off each day.</p>

<p><em>Alas, the diary stops here. We can only guess at the reason why. Fortunately I have found a tiny pocket diary for 1946 in which Edgar noted details of his last days in <span class="location" data-place-id="berlin">Berlin</span> and his long awaited journey back home. The entries read as follows:</em></p>
<p>9th February - ENSA show at Derboa. 10th February- Pictures "It's a Pleasure". 11th February- Pictures "Indiscretion". 12th February- took a stroll round the Stadium this morning, Church of Scotland Canteen tonight.</p>

<p><em>The reader will be glad to know that Edgar fulfilled his cherished wish and enjoyed a very happy home life with his beloved Winnie for a further forty five years after the war ended. He returned to his previous work as a gardener at New Hall, Sutton Coldfield. I was born in The Cottage, New Hall in August 1946. He died at the age of seventy seven years on January 26th 1990. From the time he arrived back from <span class="location" data-place-id="berlin">Berlin</span> in February 1946 after his "great adventure" Edgar never again left the shores of England.</em></p>
